# Keep-App---Built-with-React
So, I have been wondering about how React works with html, css, JS. This is the results of my learning process.

Like all website, this app starts with index.html. It loads index.js, this is just some tradition. From there, we load app.jsx. App.jsx is the actual entry point of the React app.

This app has only three components, the main page, the input field and note item. States and logics are mainly inside app, input field and note item will use callback function to change the state in the app.
Then the app will re-render using the upateded states.
